I'm no game designer or anything to that degree, I'm just a fan noticing trends which I see and how I think the systems affect them.
<!-- more -->
I really love this game so that's why I'm talking about it. I know this text will be affected by my idealism but I think the trends
are true nonetheless. Let's get into the meat of it.

Actually, let's take a step back. If you're reading this, it might be likely you're not familiar with Growtopia. Growtopia ia a 2D MMO Sandbox game
where people can have their own worlds with names. Example, I own the worlds TOTALITY, BEFRIENDLY and LIONIR. In those worlds, you can build pretty much
whatever you want. You can make a farm, pixel art, games, shops, parkours, etc. People can trade items with each other and can buy "world locks" or other
items using the in-game (untradeable) gem currency. Players can pay for gems or break blocks or trees for it. I think this sets the stage in a clear enough
fashion for the purposes of this blog post.

### Vending Machines

So when I explained the game, I mentioned trading. This is a core mechanic of the game which was introduced early on (to replace the very dangerous drop
trading method that the devs didn't want). With this mechanic, people would put dropped items for display in worlds and people would say what they want to
buy. This method of buying items without making them yourselves was very popular early on and it encouraged the admin of the world to be present otherwise
there is no sale. It also encouraged players to negotiate with them because the trading system allows this very easily. Admins being present essentially
all the time that their world was being used ensured that people were moderated somewhat (atleast according to the admin's morals).

Now... what if people didn't need to be present or even online at all to sell items? That sounds good, doesn't it? Well, yes but actually, no. Introducing
to you, vending machines. Vending machines let the owner of the world put items in it and give it a price in "world locks" (which is effectively the monetary
currency for trading). Now, why is that problematic? Well, the owner doesn't need to be online or present for the sale to happen so moderation unavoidably
gets worse in those worlds. It also means no negotiations. 

Maybe that would've been fine but then people started making worlds in the BUY+ model still widely popular today. This model is just "BUY+ITEM" so if you
 want to buy dirt blocks, you go to "BUYDIRT" or "BUYDIRTBLOCKS" and this still might not sound bad but what happened is that owners of these worlds bump
 the price more and they have no intention of negotiating. They know the power they hold and they abuse it. They intentionally ask people to leave 
 messages in places people can't read to sell cheap so they can resell high and make a profit.
  
"Just go to another world" you might say but really, vending machines killed trading worlds where people sold everything and it killed shops since availability
was better in vending worlds. So you could go to another BUY+ world for the same item and maybe you'll get lucky and they'll put a bulletin board where
you can post but most likely it's just another price jump. This has inflated the prices of many items and resulted in a net negative for moderation too.
These worlds almost always have 2-3 bots just spamming to get you to buy from their world, something that would never fly if someone was actually there.

I think that never adding them would've been better but since the crime has been done, a global trading system would be best. It would allow for prices to
down again and wouldn't rely on the BUY+ worlds (which are usually linked to another world for extra fossils, more on that later).

### Fossils

So, what if you could be rewarded with stuff by having people in your world, is that a good idea? Well, yes but actually no. You'll notice a pattern here,
these changes seem good but they are usually not. Fossil Rocks in Growtopia spawn to replace Rocks at random intervals while people are in a world, I'm
not entirely sure of the algorithm used. Anyways, you'd think this would simply push people to make better worlds to keep people in the world. In reality,
people just make you go through hoops to get you to stay longer and they'll teleport you in many worlds so those places also get fossils.

For anyone who's played this game before, you'll remember how Growtokens (a type of super currency) used to work and why they changed it. Growtokens were
the same mechanic. What happened? People made stupid links to worlds with automated parkours to make you stay in a world for a certain amount of time.
This was really annoying and a disaster, really. This was changed for rating (and then later for quests) in the Systems Update. We knew the problems
and what would happen with this system back in 2016. Why did Ubisoft bring it back?

Find another way to make fossils work. Link worlds are simply a pain and they usually advance big worlds rather than the small ones aiming for social.

### Moderation

Back in the day, maybe this is just nostalgia but I feel that not only world owners were more involved in moderation but also RTSoft's appointed moderators.
This is just my own hypothesis but I think this might've been partly because Ubisoft has less consensus on issues and that the people managing things
don't think about the children playing this game like Seth did because his own son played the game. This involvement in the game might've resulted in 
better moderation than otherwise but it's purely speculative.

In any case, Growtopia has grown a lot since then and I can see why human beings would have a tougher time dealing with this but it seems no automation of
reporting or filtering is being done. I can see someone superbroadcasting, essentially allows someone to have a message sent to every player in the game, 
with racial slurs in them against indonesians, I'll see people tell others to spam a user "gay" or that the post above is "gay". I don't know what moderators
are doing those times, maybe they're sleeping but they simply shouldn't allow people to sb things. Also, as a side note and I find this unbelievable
but there is a limit to how many people you can ignore.

There's also sbs of clear scams with links... how are these still a thing after all these years? I'll be talking more about moderation issues in Growtopia
and how I think it could be helped in a future post.

### Exclusive time items

Hear me out, this might not make a lot of sense but Growtopia has pretty much always had an elitism problem *however* it used to not affect functionality.
In the past, RTSoft made sure that items with functions were available cheaply. Early examples would be fairy wings which provided for a long time double-jump
on the cheap.

Now, I do believe this issue is real even for non-utility items but it's especially important for utility items like the MAGPLANT 5000 (for those unfamiliar
with the game, it's a very expensive item due to demand but which was only obtainable during a month back in 2018) for example. But why is that important?
First, for utility items, an increasing demand (due to increasing playerbase) and lower supply (due to people quitting, recycling, etc) makes them very
expensive and essentially unobtainable for new players. Not only that, it also means that certain players simply can't play a certain way at all and in the
case of the MAGPLANT 5000, it makes BFG[^2]s a more limited ressource for new players (which BFGs are considered good by the community for helping new players).

Now, for items that look cool, it's still a problem because people might work really hard to look a certain way but due to the supply demand, it might be impossible
to do it or it might require too much work so they'll quit because of the unhappiness seeing how much time they've spent and gotten nowhere. No items have gone
as pricey as exclusive items and they'd usually actually go down in price because they'd come back in the event and so there would be more supply therefore
making things that seemed impossible to attain more easily accessible to everyone.

I think these items have simply increased the gap between new players and the 1% which in return has increased elitism which means that less people are likely to
be friends for superficial reasons. Now, should people be better than that? Absolutely however this type of showcase of disparity has increased the behaviour.

I personally think that if we want back and added more 5k packs with new cool stuff rather than these IOTM[^3]s, we'd see cool new stuff that would allow
people to express themselves how they want without feeding this disparity.

### Friend system

The friend system was introduced back in November 2013 and it has not evolved well. It's a good idea of course, it's just executed poorly.

Currently, there is no search button and only about 25 people are shown per page, this quickly becomes a pain in the ass to navigate. Not only that but it
is menus in menus in menus to do anything, that is annoying. Also, in 2020, you can't send messages to friends which are offline, there's also no history
at all. There's no bio, no link, nothing. It's so barebones and the only improvement we've had in these 7 years are that we now have options to set ourselves
as away, online or busy and we can see how long ago he last connection was. It also has a limit of 400 people with 50 online people maximum.

Please provide search. Please provide offline messaging. Please provide a bio or something that allows me to tell people about myself. Please let me have more
frends. I don't think this is too much to ask for.

Anyways, that's all I have to say for now. You might find interresting ["Two guys made an MMO: The Growtopia Postmortem"](https://www.codedojo.com/?p=1620) about some early Growtopia history, I
particularly found interresting Seth's thoughts on the freemium model, ["Seth answers Growtopia questions (FAQ)"](https://www.codedojo.com/?p=2597) responding to some FAQ such as why RTSoft sold Growtopia, some
level of regret with introducing vending machines.
