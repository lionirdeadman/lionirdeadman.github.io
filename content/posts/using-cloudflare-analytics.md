This is both a warning and explanation. I will explore why I'm using [Cloudflare Web Analytics](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/).
<!--more-->
Now, for first, it's free so it's definitely something I can afford to do. I'd love use [Plausible](https://plausible.io) and I'd recommend anyone who can afford it to do so but being a student, I try to keep subcriptions to a minimum and it's simply too expensive.

Why do I want analytics? Well... while it is fun to scream in the void, it is just that because I get virtually no feedback. I want to see that atleast people are reading this and potentially what people like the most. Maybe how it gets shared around (although it probably doesn't).

So why Cloudflare outside of price? Well, I obviously don't want Google Analytics because I don't trust Google and they're known for using that data in ways I don't like. So what other choices do I have for something free? Well, not much really.

Also, Cloudflare claims :
> Cloudflare Web Analytics does not use any client-side state, such as cookies or localStorage, to collect usage metrics. We also don’t “fingerprint” individuals via their IP address, User Agent string, or any other data for the purpose of displaying analytics. 

Assuming this is true, I think I'm fine with that. So, well, that's why.

By the way, I have some ideas of posts to make so look forward to that. I've been quite busy with school lately so that's why I've not written much lately.
