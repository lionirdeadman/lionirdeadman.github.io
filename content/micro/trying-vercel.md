I'm currently trying out Vercel for dev builds as to showcase new posts to people more easily and have people
comment on designs since responsive design is hard to put into pictures.

Hopefully it works out. The performance due to Vercel's edge network not being as expansive is a bit underwhelming but
the features it provides I think are worth it. I don't think anyone will spit on loading times which are .2s slower.

It turns out that Vercel doesn't `no-index` if using a custom domain so my hope to have a cool dev.thelion.website is over.
That sucks.
