Just a quick post to say this website is now on gemini on the same domain.
<!--more-->
Why? Well, Sourcehut provides support for it and I kinda felt like it.

Do I think that gemini is good? Honestly, not really. It doesn't provide much design opportunities, it's very limiting and not well supported. I just can't see it ever being an alternative for the web which is unfortunate because I thing really should exist but I guess it's some fun for some people so I might as well while I can.

Tell me if you use it and why. Hopefully you like my writing whether it's on gemini or http.
