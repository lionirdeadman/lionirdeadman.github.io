New domain just dropped! Essentially, the tl;dr : shorter name, more precise, more accepted tld.
<!--more-->
Honestly, a lot of it has to do with email. Quite a few too many times, services would ask to enter a valid email after entering my email address. I just got tired of it.

It makes me regret my original domain as I wish I would've known that. It resulted in me not following my principles on domain names and emails. This .ca TLD should be accepted everywhere.

Though I regret it, I do think this slightly shorter, less awkward domain is better. Hopefully you like it too.
