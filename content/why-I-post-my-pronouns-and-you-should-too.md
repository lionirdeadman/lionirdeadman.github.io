This is mostly a post for future reference but maybe people can learn more about how I see things.
<!--more-->
I recently was asked by someone why I put my pronouns publicly in bios, I forget who and I forget where but it doesn't matter anyways.

I believe it was a fair question. Why would a cis person put their pronouns like this? "It's obvious that I'm male", they said.

Well, first of all, this isn't obvious. I'm not sure if it's just the internet circles I'm in but the profile pictures don't align with the gender
you'd think they are. So even if we assume cisnormativity (more on this very shortly) and that you can guess someone's gender, this doesn't quite work.

I'll try to explain in detail why it doesn't work and why we should be presenting this information.

## What is cisnormativity?

What is cisnormativity? Let's check [the wiktionary definition](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cisnormativity) :

> The assumption that all human beings are cisgender, i.e. have a gender identity which matches their biological sex.

I think this is a fair starting point. So, most people are cisgendered and you might think you can guess. However, that's exactly the problem
with norms. It is true that you can probably do this and be right most of the time but by doing so, you will unavoidably make people
living outside of the norm feel alienated, excluded and hurt.

As a sidenote, I do want to point out that pronouns don't necessarily align with someone's gender. You can
think of this like people who dress in a feminine fashion even though they're male. It's just easier to talk about it in terms of gender for me.

Now, if you're like how I used to be, you might be thinking "Oh, only snowflakes get hurt by that". Well, if you're
a guy, do you like being called a girl? I think in most cases, at least from anecdotal evidence, people take it as an insult. That's not
to say being a certain gender is bad but being called something you're not is usually not flattering, let's put it that way.

But also, for people outside of this norm, it's even worse because it most likely happens often and it will probably make them feel
like they don't belong, make them remember this feeling that they're in the wrong body.

## Fighting it

Put your pronouns everywhere you can. Tell people your pronouns. If people don't tell you, don't feel scared to ask! 
It'll probably feel awkward at first but you'll get used it. It's part of the process.

If you mess up, it's fine, don't worry about it. Apologizing too much is probably gonna make people feel like they're asking too much so just
continue talking and use the right pronoun from that moment.

This way, I try to break the pattern of assumptions regarding pronouns and gender. I try to be more inclusive with my language.

As a result, I can show that I am there for people and that I care about this.

You make people feel more comfortable doing the same.

I try to do it even with cis friends. Otherwise, I think it might come out awkward to people who know me and kinda act like a signal
to people that the person I'm presenting isn't cis which is a shame.

Anyways, this is why I do it.
