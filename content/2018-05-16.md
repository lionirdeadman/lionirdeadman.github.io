Okay so I've been thinking about the best way for people reading my blog to contact me and I think I've found a solution which is pretty good.. comments! Okay, here's why that's a good way.
<!-- more -->

### 1. Control

With the comment system in place, I don't have a contact page but that's good, you'll just comment and put your email address and other ways I can contact you there and then I can contact you when I want, this means that I won't risk getting spammed as much.

### 2. Privacy

The messages will not be public until I approve them so if you give me your contact information inside the comment, I'll simply delete it and it'll never be seen by other people.

### 3. Just.. comments!

If you post a comment regarding the article / blog post, I'll approve it and people will be able to see it and reply to you. I think it'll be really cool to see what you all think of this and it won't feel like I'm talking to myself anymore, haha.

Oh! I almost forgot, the javascript and third-party service provider will not be loaded until you click the "Show comments" button so you can still read it without a third-party snooping on you.
