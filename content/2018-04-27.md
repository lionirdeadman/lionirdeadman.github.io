Well, for one, it's free. "Okay, and?", you may be saying. 
I don't have the burden of hosting. I can simply code away the html and not worry about anything else..

Not only that but since there's no database or anything, just static files.
I've also further restricted myself by not using javascript (although that may change)

Why? Because the web is bloated and it takes way too long to load most
pages and they're just filled with ads, trackers, javascript and other crap.

So I'm just gonna post from here from time to time some decently-sized posts..
You can also subsribe to the [RSS](https://lionirdeadman.codeberg.page/atom.xml) to see whenever I post something
on here without making an account and stuff.
