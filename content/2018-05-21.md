This whole blog's source code is now licensed under AGPLv3, celebrate! Okay, the code is pretty crappy but that's another story, hopefully it improves. Feel free to contribute!

I may have broken some things with some of the changes I did but I think it's okay. At least, when I tested locally, who knows what'll happen once this thing goes on Neocities. Hopefully nothing otherwise that'd suck.

I'm still waiting for someone to actually comment on here which kind of stinks, I was hoping for people to do so! Who are those 1660 (at the time of this writing) people who saw this blog? What do they think? It really interests me.

Anyhow, that's off-topic and so, I'll just end this blog post here. Oh, right! The source code is here I may have a mirror on GitHub later, maybe, we'll see if anyone wants me to do so. Well, that's all I had to say, have a good day y'all!
