Oh boy, it's been a long time. I remade the site from scratch, how will things be going forward?
<!-- more -->

I'm not good at introductions so let's just go, please.

### How is the website made now?

I caved in! I am now using Zola.

### Where's all the pictures?

They're gone, they were never really used meaningfully. They were just me trying to make things look cool and well, there was no
clear theme or style and it started to bother me.

### Where's the mistakes section?

It never went anywhere with mind being scared, honestly. I think it's better if I fill it in with more current mistakes than charging
it with the past, it's easier for me and probably makes more sense for you. Sorry.

### Can I still follow the Atom feed?

Yes! I believe I didn't break the feed so it should be all a-ok!

### Waaaa, where are all the semantics?

They're coming back, I still need to tame the beast more and I'll be implementing them more and more.

### What am I going to do with this site going forward?
