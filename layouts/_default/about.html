          <!-- About me -->
          <p>Hi! I'm <span class="p-name">Lionir Deadman</span> but just can just call me <span class="p-given-name">Lio</span> for short. My pronouns are
          <a href="https://pronoun.is/he/him/his" class="p-pronoun p-pronouns"><span class="p-pronoun-nominative">he</span>/<span class="p-pronoun-oblique">him</span>/<span class="p-pronoun-possessive">his</span></a>.
          Nice to meet you!</p>
          <p class="p-note">I'm not sure how to present myself. I'd say I tend to be quite pragmatic in how I talk even though I think I'm generally rather emotionally aware and a good listener.
          I don't think that this means that my rationality is more important to me than my emotional sensibility but rather that I'm not really sure how to be useful outside of a pragmatic approach.
          <br /><br />
          I have a wide range of interests. I advocate for privacy, freedom, better working conditions and more generally human rights. I think often about how power structures (for example, capitalism)
          affect people. I like to talk about what I think is good design. I also quite enjoy anime. I'm always looking to learn new things!
